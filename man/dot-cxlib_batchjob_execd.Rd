\description{
The internal routine is in effect a runner deamon that can be executed as
either a foreground process (wait for the routine to end) or a background
process (do not wait for it to end).

The routine uses the \verb{*-action-*} files in the directory specified by \code{x}.
The action file is a JSON data file with action attributes and directives.

The natural sort order of the action files is the action queue. The queue of
actions are processed one at a time sequentially , e.g. \verb{001-action-*} is
processed before \verb{002-action-*}.

A file that ends \verb{*.json} is an action that is queued and not started or
completed.

A file that ends \verb{*.lck} is an action that is currently being executed and
not completed.

A file that ends \verb{*-completed.json} is an action that is completed.

The routine is persistent and will continue to execute until all actions have
been completed.

Signal interrupts are currently not supported.
